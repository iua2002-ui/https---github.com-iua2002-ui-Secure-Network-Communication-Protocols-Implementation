## **Repository Description**

This repository provides Python implementations of two essential secure communication protocols:

1. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: A client-server implementation of the Diffie-Hellman protocol, which allows two parties to securely establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. This shared secret can then be used for symmetric encryption.

2. **SSL Web Client/Server**: A simple SSL-enabled web client and server that demonstrate secure communication using HTTPS. The server can serve HTTP responses over an SSL/TLS connection, and the client can send HTTP requests securely.

### Key Features:
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**:
  - Client and server scripts for secure key exchange.
  - Random base and prime modulus selection for enhanced security.
  - Shared secret computation using modular arithmetic.

- **SSL Web Client/Server**:
  - SSL/TLS support for secure HTTP communication.
  - Peer certificate verification for client-side security.
  - Customizable HTTP responses for demonstration purposes.

### Use Cases:
- Learning and experimenting with secure communication protocols.
- Demonstrating the principles of key exchange and SSL/TLS.
- Building a foundation for more complex secure communication systems.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- SSL/TLS certificates (for SSL web server). Self-signed certificates can be generated using OpenSSL.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Diffie-Hellman client and server to observe key exchange.
3. Run the SSL web server and client to observe secure HTTP communication.

### Contributions:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for improvements or additional features.
